//  Hardware required:
//    Pushbutton on GPIO0 which pulls it to GND when pressed
//
//      enter your own SSID / password as well as IP ADDRESS an port (+ credentials if required) lf MQTT broker
//
//      then browse to http://testbed.local IF you have avahi / bonjour / other mDNS on your network
//      otherwise you will have to watch the serial window and find the IP address
//      then browse to http://<wha.tev.ver.IP>
//
//      Flashing can be started manually via SHORT press 3-stage on GPIO0 - WARNING > 2sec will reboot, > 5 will factory reset.
//      LED can turn  on/off via web ui, via web "REST" and MQTT command
//      OR - better still: "Alexa! Turn on testbed" / "Alexa! Turn off testbed"
//
//      Also, go into Tool page on webUI and change value of "blinkrate" - LED will automatically change rate
//
//
//      We subscribe to "flash" expecting payload of 0 / 1 to set LED flashing at rate determined by CI "blinkrate"
//      We also "wild/#" We would LIKE to receive "wild/hearts", "wild/clubs". "wild/diamonds" and "wild/spades" 
//      with a payload of A,2,3,4...10,J,Q,K but # in mqtt allows anything (That's the point!)
//      So we will also receive wild/cups wild/wands etc even wild/!"Â£$%487632545239080 so its up to US to validate
//      the input and only reat to what we expect, ignoring all else.
//
//      Up till now, all MQTT commands have been directed to thsi device specificall - e have only ever
//      subscribed to topics starting with our device name. Esparto allows us to also subscribe to topics that OTHER
//      devices can also subscribe to...for example you may want all your IOT to "listen out" for topics starting "all"
//      so that. for example all/cmd/reboot will...well have a guess.
//  
//     In this example then, testbed/flash [0 or 1] will cause only this device to flash, even if you have
//      many versions running, whereas any command starting cards/... will be picked up by all at the same time.
//
//    To test it send cards/wild/spades [A] for the Ace of Spades
//     then try clubs diamonds etc, finally try cards/wild/anyoldrubbish
//     then try cards/wild/anyoldrubbish/morejunk/lotsoflevels ["a big lot of text in the payload"]
//     also try testbed/wild/spades [A] - nothing will happen, as its only listening when the sender is "cards"
//
//    On each valid card, we publish the topic "dealt" woht a payload showinng value  + suit
